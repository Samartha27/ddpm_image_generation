# Mini_DDMP



## Problem statement


## Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) 


## Data Augmentation
Even though the training images look like a masked image, they're  3 channel images and have a size of `32x32`.  The images are normalized using mean as ```[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]``` and standard deviation as ```[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]``` 

# Model preparation 


## Model training and experimentation 
Each model is trained on a NVIDIA  GTX 1050 Ti  GPU.
