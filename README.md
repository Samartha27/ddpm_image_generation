## Abstract


## Problem statement




## Methodology


## Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) 
Training is with the use of 3 channel images have a size of `32x32`.  The images are normalized using mean as ```[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]``` and standard deviation as ```[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]``` 



## Experiments
Our model is trained on NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti GPU.
